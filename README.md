How Can I Convert A Integer To Binary?
There are two possible values for 1 bit: On/Off, which corresponds to 1/0. On is equal to 1, while Off is equal to 0. A 2-bit system can have four values.

Therefore, an 8-bit system can have 256 values. A byte is equivalent to 8 bits. When each bit has a value of 1, we obtain the number 255. This is the highest value we can obtain. Including 0, the total number of values it can represent becomes 256.

Each bit is expressed as a power of two. This way:

When we add the green parts, it gives us the number 110.

Thats it!
